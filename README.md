# ML-Course
 Machine Learning course's projects
<br>
These are the projects from a Macine Learning course I took at the university.
<br>
<br>
Project 1: Linear Regression
<br>
Project 2: Decision Trees
<br>
Project 3: Classifiers - MAP, MLE, Naive Bayes and Full Bayes
<br>
Project 4: Logistic Regression, NB and EM
<br>
Project 6: K-Means
<br>
<br>
* Project 5 was a theoretical assignment, thus missing. *
<br>
 ** For every project there is a Jupyter notebook for testing the code and an explanations on the implementations of the code. **
